git init -> to initialize the git repository for that directory, that has hidden file and folders that maintains all the changes and version of the folder.

git status -> to check the status of the folder, whethere there are some untracked files present or not.

git add {filename} -> to track the file. i.e. now this file is not more untracked.

git add . -> to track all the changs made.

git commit -m "give some message here " -> to commit/permanent all the changes.

git restore --staged {filename} -> to track back to the previous file removing the saving of it.
 
git log -> to check all the history/commit made by us.

commit made by git is based on one above other, thus you can't delete commit of the mid.
you can remove it by:

git reset {jo remove krna chah rhe hai usse just previous commit ko write kr do} 

git stash -> if we don't want to commit but also don't want to lose the change, so it saves it
git stash pop -> to get back to our work.
git stash clear -> for permanent remove that part i.e. deleting the stash 

pull request -> suppose you are working on a features, definitely it should be on new branch, you have to create pull request for it to merge it to main branch. 
one pull request can contains many commit in that branch.

That's why if we are working over 10 features, then we create 10 branch, and commits are done separately to these branches.
